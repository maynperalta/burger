## Usage
Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant application for users to input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Users can type in the name of a burger and place it into a list. From that list, users can keep track of which burgers have been eaten by placing them into a "Devoured" list. A video demonstration of the functionality of the application can be found [here](https://youtu.be/hfP5SDb8Dk0).
